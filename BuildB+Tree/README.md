# What does this do?
For sake of simplicity, this project builds a B+ tree data structure.

# Is this all of my code?
Much of the implementation is of my own. Some of the basic setup and testcases are from Russell Wakefield.

# Why upload this?
B+ Trees were notoriously known as one of the hardest data structures to implement for younger programmers.
I was very proud that I was able to understand the concept and write code successfully.
